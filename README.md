# NOTES


1. **Netlify Ð¸ MongoDB:** The project uses free plans from Netlify for hosting and MongoDB for the database. Because of this, there may be delays in the operation of the backend and payment system Stripe. In some cases, especially when starting for the first time, loading may take up to 1 minute.
2. **Test credit card for Stripe verification.** To test the payment system, use the following test data:
   - Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - CVC: any three digits (for example, 123)
   - Card expiration date: any future month and year (for example, 12/25)

After entering this data, the payment will be successfully processed in test mode.
